% FORMAT [mf_SNR, mb_SNR] = ME_GLM_SNR(Y, X, V, B) calculates model-free
% as well as model-based signal-to-noise ratios for a general linear model
% with data Y, design matrix X and covariance matrix V.
% 
% The model-free signal-to-noise ratio (SNR-mf) is defined as the inverse
% of the coefficient of variation (CV), i.e. as the ratio of mean against
% standard deviation of the measured signal.
% 
% The model-based signal-to-noise ratio (SNR-mb) is defined as the ratio of
% signal variance against noise variance, i.e. as variance of the explained
% signal divided by the variance of the residual signal.
% 
% Please note that the parameter estimates B must be consistent with the
% covariance assumptions V. This means, they have to be calculated as
%     B = (X'*inv(V)*X)^-1 * X'*inv(V)*Y .
% This weighted least squares (WLS) approach is equivalent to whitening
% data and design with a whitening matrix W = sqrtm(inv(V)) before analysis
% and reduces to ordinary least squares (OLS) or maximum likelihood (ML)
% estimation where errors are assumed i.i.d., such that V = eye(n):
%     B = (X'*X)^-1 * X'*Y ,
% If this is case, the input variable V can also be left empty.
